Below is the context of the scene we want for my AI-generated video. 
We're using Google Veo 3 to actually generate the scenes. It allows for video 
and audio output all in one.

HOWEVER Veo 3 has clear limitations:
- each video it generates is 8 seconds max (so you must prompt it accordingly)

Your goal is to write one prompt that I will give to Veo 3 to generate 
one 8-second clips. Ensure NONE of these are at all ambiguous. Leave nothing to chance.

You have to think like a directorüé¨ not just a describerüó£Ô∏è, Using terms like the
 "dolly zoom" wide shot and setting the tone with things like "90s VHS footage"
  or "documentary style"
Be hyper-specificü§è with characters and scenes. Instead of "a man", describe his 
clothes, his expression, and the "moody lighting" of the room he's in. The more 
detail the better
Instruct the soundüîä You can literally write dialogue in the prompt like a 
script (Guy: "whoa" *excited with tears in their eyes*) and tell it what kind 
of music to play
Structure your prompts like a mini-story, use words like "first...", "then...", 
"followed by..." or even just use numbers

don't need opening and end, videos should start with a "cold open" because people have short attention span, no subtitles

VERY IMPORTANT: don't mention any names of public figures or products in the prompt.

To do your best work here, first, think for at least 25 paragraphs inside 
<thinking> tags, and then put your prompts, in an ordered list, inside <prompts>
 tags.
