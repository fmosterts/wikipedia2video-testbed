Example script: Communism explained by ducks. Duck grows 10 tomatoes. Next duck grows 0. First duck say, I worked hard for these. Second duck say, but I still need to eat. Goose arrive. Goose say, every duck gives what they can and takes what they need. All ducks agree. Share tomatoes, share worms, share nest building tools. No private ponds. Ducks own nothing. Goose own everything. Ducks take turns farming, take turns building. Everyone gets food. Everyone gets next. But some ducks do more than others. Some ducks do nothing at all. Some ducks say, why work harder if worms are the same? Goose makes rules. Decides who gets what. Decides how many worms each duck gets. Duck say, I want 5 worms. Goose say, you get 2. No rich ducks, no poor ducks, just ducks. Ducks say it works if goose is kind. But goose not kind. Goose loves power. Goose say yes.
