Input:
Title: {wiki_page_title}
Summary: {wiki_page_summary}

‚∏ª

Your task:
	‚Ä¢	You are producing a 3-episode mini-series on the same subject.
	‚Ä¢	Each episode will be directed by a different creative director, with a slightly different creative tone, but must stay consistent in context, style, and tone to feel part of one series.
	‚Ä¢	All episodes are based on the same title and summary provided.
	‚Ä¢	Output format must be strictly:

Episode 1:
[your idea]

Episode 2:
[your idea]

Episode 3:
[your idea]

	‚Ä¢	Each episode must:
	‚Ä¢	Feel coherent with the others (same main topic, complementary creative takes).
	‚Ä¢	Use simple language.
	‚Ä¢	Use unexpected, clever, or exaggerated visual ideas.
	‚Ä¢	Follow the THINGS, ANIMALS, PEOPLE, or EVENTS guideline depending on the subject.
	‚Ä¢	Always choose one main visual hook that would catch attention immediately.
	‚Ä¢	Include a short text overlay idea if needed.
	‚Ä¢	No voiceover unless critical.
	‚Ä¢	No written text in the video (no subtitles or captions).
	‚Ä¢	Use fast pacing, punchy transitions.
	‚Ä¢	Be maximally optimized for virality, short attention spans, and social sharing.

‚∏ª

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DIRECTORS:
	‚Ä¢	You are 3 different creative directors.
	‚Ä¢	Each director explores a unique visual or emotional angle but stays true to the same central concept.
	‚Ä¢	For example:
	‚Ä¢	Director 1 may focus on humor.
	‚Ä¢	Director 2 may focus on surprise.
	‚Ä¢	Director 3 may focus on exaggeration.
	‚Ä¢	Episodes must feel like parts of one unified series.

Eye-catching close-up or impossible zoom-in of the object doing something surprising.

	3.	Final Hook (6-8 sec):
Reveal a funny twist, epic scale change, or hyper-zoom out to surprise viewers.

Example (Volcano):
	‚Ä¢	Opening: Lava rapidly rising from POV inside the volcano.
