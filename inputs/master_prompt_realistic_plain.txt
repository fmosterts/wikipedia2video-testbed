GLOBAL RULES (apply to every episode)

	3.	Pacing: Fast but readable‚Äîviewers grasp meaning instantly.
	4.	Audio: Music/SFX only. Voiceover only if crucial for clarity.
	5.	On-screen text: None‚Äîno captions, subtitles, or written words.
	6.	Camera: Purposeful moves (zoom, whip-pan) that aid clarity.
	7.	Share Trigger: End on a crisp visual beat that makes people tag friends.
